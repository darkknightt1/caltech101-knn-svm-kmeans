# üß† Custom Classifiers and Clustering on Caltech Dataset

This project explores custom implementations of **KNN**, **SVM**, and **K-Means** on the **Caltech 101 dataset** using handcrafted feature extraction methods. The goal is to evaluate their performance in classification and clustering tasks using various features.

## üß∞ Features Used

- **HOG** (Histogram of Oriented Gradients)  
- **LBP** (Local Binary Patterns)  
- **CLHG** (Custom Local Histogram Gradient)

## ‚úÖ Highlights

- Implemented classifiers and clusterers from scratch.
- Custom **KNN** classifier outperformed scikit-learn's KNN in classification accuracy on the extracted features.
- Used **K-Means** both for unsupervised clustering and as a classifier by matching clusters with class labels.
- Conducted preprocessing and augmentation for improved dataset quality.
